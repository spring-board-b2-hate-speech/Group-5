Hate Speech Detection in Facebook
Hate speech is any kind of communication that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes like race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. It aims to dehumanize, degrade, or threaten targeted groups.In an era overflowing with social media content, distinguishing between genuine expression and hateful speech has become increasingly difficult. This project addresses the critical need for automated hate speech detection by implementing a comprehensive solution using Python and machine learning techniques.
Leveraging both synthetic datasets containing simulated hateful content and real-world datasets representing legitimate social media interactions, we can develop an end-to-end pipeline for hate speech classification.
